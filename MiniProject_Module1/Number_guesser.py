## Main goal:Our chatbot is going to guess a number, and the user has to guess that number with given hints.
##You need to write a number guesser class to guess a number in a range of your choosing and can give the user three hints. 
# You must implement the required properties for the class to have a random number in the range you want and five properties to use as hints(parity, factors, multiples, larger, smaller).

    def __init__(self,number):
        self.number=number
    def desciption(self):
